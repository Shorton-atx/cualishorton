     <h3>LSC 555 Assignment #1</h3>
     <h3>Samantha Horton</h3>

     <h2>Context</h2>
     <p>Project Gutenberg is a library of over 70,000 free eBooks that are available to the public to read and download. Founded by Michael Hart, who invented eBooks in 1971, the website is now run completely by volunteers. Anyone can add eBooks to the collection as long as they follow the guidelines, most importantly that the published book is not currently protected by copyright (i.e. they are in the public domain) in the United States of America. </p>

     <h2>Users</h2>
     <p> Anyone can use Project Gutenberg. Although it might seem like an excellent tool for scholars trying to find copies of older works such as primary sources, when you look at the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top#books-last1">“Top 100 eBooks yesterday”</a> under the “Frequently Downloaded” header it becomes evident that most people use the site to locate free versions of popular fiction books. The current top 5 off the list of 100 for example are: Frankenstein by Mary Shelley, Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare, Moby Dick by Herman Melville, and The Scarlett Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Many of these books are classics you might find as part of a high school English class curriculum so it is also not too much of a leap to assume that teachers and/or students use this site often to access class materials. Indeed, works by Shakespeare seem to be a particularly popular selection, as out of the 25 <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/help/"> help topics </a> listed on the site, which include things like “Copyright How-To” and “Policies”, there is a help topic simply called “Shakespeare Books” that takes users to the full listing. Shakespeare also holds this special place because the Michael Hart’s father was a Shakespeare scholar, and they collaborated together to digitize all of Shakespeare as some of the first eBooks on the site.</p>

     <h2>Content</h2>
     <p> Under the “Search and Browse” tab at the top of the website, users can search using quick search (the most basic option of just typing in a title or topic), advanced search (which lets the user fill in fields like Author, Title, Subject, Language, Category, Filetype, etc.), browsing options (including by first letter of author or title, the specific language, or the books searched the most in the last 24 hours, 7 days or 30 days). Once the user selects the book they want they can see an image of the cover next to options to read the book online or download in different formats such as for the Kindle or in plain text UTF-8. The user can also see bibliographic information on the eBook in question under “About this eBook” such as author, title, original publication, contents/summary, language, copyright status, and how many times it’s been downloaded in the last 30 days. In addition to eBooks, Project Gutenberg also offers a small selection of audiobooks (662 titles read by people and 386 generated by computers using text to speech automation).</p>

     <h2>Features</h2>
     <p> One of the most interesting features of the site is the amount of different download options for its titles. Instead of just offering users the ability to read the text on the web, they can choose to download the book into another version to make reading it easier: for example on their Kindle or other E-Reader. Another feature is the provision of the LoC No. or the Library of Congress catalogue number for the physical book versions of some of the eBooks. Users can click on the LoC number to access more information on the title and even find a physical copy available at another library if they desire. The subject tags under “About this eBook” are also helpful in leading user to similar books or topics, such as “Archeology” and “Egypt — Antiquities”. </p>

     <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
          <ul>
	     <li> The eBook format makes these books very accessible to anyone with a computer. </li>
	     <li>You don’t need to pay for a title or put in a request at a library and wait for it to become available — these eBooks are right at your fingertips. </li>
	     <li>Because of the formatting that goes into creating the eBooks, they are also fairly navigable — often but not always formatted with hyperlinked tables of contents and page numbers of the original physical book placed on the right side of the digitized text. </li>
	     <li>Images in the books are also reproduced well in the digital versions. </li>
	     <li>You can also search through the whole eBook for particular words using Command F.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
	     <li>Some cons to the site include its design, which is very barebones likely due to the fact that it is run by volunteers and rightly prioritizes its contents over its presentation.</li>
	     <li>It would be nice to be able to click on the images of the book covers and see a blown up version of that image to see the details more clearly. </li>
	     <li>Also, there is no option to save a title to come back to later.</li>
	     <li> Although the website has some audio options, it would also be beneficial from an accessibility standpoint to have some kind of text to speech button as an option to convert the eBooks on demand into audio files for anyone with impaired vision or simply a preference for listening over reading. </li>
          </ul>

     <h2>Improvements</h2>
     <p id="lastheading"> Many issues with the site, such as aesthetic choices, could probably be remedied with more funding. It is incredible what Project Gutenberg has done with volunteer resources. In general, I think users might enjoy having some sort of option to save or like titles that they are interested in so that they can come back to them at a later date and remember what they were looking at. Providing that service would probably involve some sort of user login, which would take work to add to the site, but could be beneficial in getting more funding to the project as they could potentially request a small optional donation when the login is created and also send out emails to the users with logins with updates, requests, newsletters, etc. to spread the word on what they are doing and hopefully gain more support to continue improving the site and providing more free titles for people to access. </p>
